    <h1>Euclidean Lattices and Hofstadter Butterflies</h1>
    <p>Condensed matter physics realizes the importance of 2D materials when it comes to the observation of interesting phenomena (ie. optical, magnetic, etc) and topological properties as well as technological applications. Different 2D materials have different underlying lattice structures. Some common ones are the square lattice, the honeycomb lattice, triangular/hexagonal lattice, and the kagome lattice.

These lattices can be described via Hamiltonians encoding how a species could "hop" between adjacent sites (nearest neighbors). A useful way to understand these systems is by diagonalizing the associated Hamiltonians to obtain allowed energies and states, and use these eigenvalues and eigenvectors to compute various parameters. In general, it is useful to plot the eigenvalue spectrum, different eigenvectors, density of states, and the inverse participation ratio. In the case of a magnetic field application perpendicular to the lattice, plotting the Hofstader butterfly is a primary result. Generally, the band structure of these systems is useful to compute, but energy band theory is dependent on the concept of crytal momentum --- a relevant parameter when it comes to describing translational symmetry in the lattice via Bloch's theorem. However, Bloch's theorem does not hold in cases like hyperbolic lattice connectivity. There is also little support for computing Hofstadter butterflies, while there exist multiple Python packages referring to band theory calculations. This brings us to what is interesting about the implementation of lattice simulations in this repository:

We create base cases for the most common, physically realizable lattice types without reliance on crystal momentum to allow for extending this code to cases where Bloch's theorem no longer holds.

We account for the presence of additional on-site disorder as well as a constant, perpendicular magnetic field. This allows us to simulate Anderson localization and plot Hofstader butterflies with and without disorder. The magnetic field support also allows for further invesitgation into the quantum hall effect.

The classes creating the hamiltonians for each lattice type can be modified or refactored to support additional parameters or more accurately reflect a particular type of material such as graphene.</p>
